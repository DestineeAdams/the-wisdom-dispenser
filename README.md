# The-wisdom-dispenser
A full-stack web app that allows you to receive and share wisdom with random strangers on the internet. It uses a custom API I also built, check out the API [here](https://github.com/DestineeAdams/WisdomDisperserAPI)

Tech used: JavaScript, node.js, express, dotenv, ejs, api

## Optimizations

- Need a feature to flag offensive content.  
- Need to check if **true duplicates** are being added to the database. Currently, if there is a punctuation difference or an extra space between two entries *even if the words are the same* they are treated as different quotes.
  - ### **Fixes:**
    - **Fix One:** Write a function that removes all whitespace and punctuation from the quote and author in the user input. Do the same with every author in the database(sorted alphabetically), and check if that quote already exists.
